            <h2>A little about me</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I am currently a senior at The University of Massachusetts Amherst, and am majoring in Computer Science</li>
                <li>I am proficient in Javascript, Typescript, Python, HTML, CSS, and have a foundational understanding of C</li>
                <li>I chose to major in Computer Science because of the happiness that videogames brought me as a child and was always fascinated by how someone could make them. I believe coding can be a form of art if you're passionate enough.</li>
                <li>So coding is not only hopefully my future career but also a real passion of mine</li>
