                <li>I am currently a senior at The University of Massachusetts Amherst, and am majoring in Computer Science</li>
                <li>I am proficient in Javascript, Typescript, Python, HTML, CSS, and have a foundational understanding of C</li>
                <li>I chose to major in Computer Science because of the happiness that videogames brought me as a child and was always fascinated by how someone could make them. I believe coding can be a form of art if you're passionate enough.</li>
                <li>So coding is not only hopefully my future career but also a real passion of mine</li>

            <p>Academix is a website I built as part of a group project for a class, 
                where the main objective was to develop a functional application. In 
                this project, I had the opportunity to lead the team, which involved 
                conceptualizing the project idea, assigning tasks to teammates, and 
                providing assistance whenever needed. Academix is designed to be a study
                 and class management tool, similar to Canvas but with a focus on enhancing 
                 study efficiency. Students can add their current classes, track homework 
                 and due dates, and monitor their mastery of various topics, identifying 
                 areas that need more attention. This project was pivotal in developing my 
                 frontend and backend skills. Through it, I gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, 
                 JavaScript, and Express.js, providing a comprehensive learning experience 
                 in web development.

                <li>
                    One of my earliest and most memorable projects, undertaken while I was first learning Java, was a Markov Chain Story Generator. This project introduced me to the concept of Markov chains and their powerful applications. I developed a program that allows users to input any text, such as books, which the program then cleans and converts into Markov chains. The user specifies a number to determine the length of word sequences the program analyzes. Based on this, the program identifies the most common subsequent words, randomly selects one, and continues this process until a coherent story is generated. The logic behind this ensures that the stories maintain coherence, as the program does not arbitrarily choose words but follows a sound algorithmic approach. A notable feature of my program is its ability to process large texts, such as the entire Bible, and generate a story from it relatively quickly. This project not only enhanced my understanding of Java but also demonstrated the practical applications of Markov chains in text generation.
