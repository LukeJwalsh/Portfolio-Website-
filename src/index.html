                                showcase my skills and projects. I hope you enjoy your stay!</li>

                            <li><strong>EDUCATION - </strong>I am currently a senior at The University of Massachusetts Amherst, 
                                majoring in Computer Science. My coursework has covered data structures, 
                                advanced algorithms, and very in depth classes behind theoretical foundations 
                                of the math and algorithims that make up computer science. 
                                Previously, I was also a  Data Science major at Bryant University, where I learned to 
                                gather and interpert data and also the fundamentals of data analysis. Now, with a solid foundation 
                                of the theory behind computer science and what makes a good program, my main goal 
                                 now is to hone my coding skills, which I will achieve through various passion projects that I will display here.</li>

                            <li>Originally, I started as a Data Science major at Bryant University and maintained 
                                a 3.9 GPA. However, I felt something was missing. I wanted to dive deeper into 
                                coding and truly create something, and eventually lead to creating a beautiful complex program with a team. 
                                This deeo feeling led me to transfer to UMass 
                                Amherst to pursue my dream in Computer Science, whihc has been one of the best decision I've made. </li>

                            <li><strong>SKILLS - </strong>Now that you know who I am, let me share a brief intro to my skills. I am proficient in JavaScript, TypeScript, 
                                Python, HTML, and CSS, and have 
                                a foundational understanding of C. I've worked on many challenging projects, 
                                some of which are showcased on this website and my GitHub. Coding is truly my passion,
                                 and I'm always eager to take on new projects to refine my skills and expand my portfolio.</li>

                                on this website. Whether you're a fellow student or a potential employer,

                <li>

            <p>Academix is a website I built as part of a group project for a class, 
                where the main objective was to develop a functional application. In 
                this project, I had the opportunity to lead the team, which involved 
                conceptualizing the project idea, assigning tasks to teammates, and 
                providing assistance whenever needed. Academix is designed to be a study
                 and class management tool, similar to Canvas but with a focus on enhancing 
                 study efficiency. Students can add their current classes, track homework 
                 and due dates, and monitor their mastery of various topics, identifying 
                 areas that need more attention. This project was pivotal in developing my 
                 frontend and backend skills. Through it, I gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, 
                 JavaScript, and Express.js, providing a comprehensive learning experience 
                 in web development.

            <ul class="project-description">
                <li>
                    One of my earliest and most memorable projects, undertaken while I was first learning Java, was a Markov Chain Story Generator. This project introduced me to the concept of Markov chains and their powerful applications. I developed a program that allows users to input any text, such as books, which the program then cleans and converts into Markov chains. The user specifies a number to determine the length of word sequences the program analyzes. Based on this, the program identifies the most common subsequent words, randomly selects one, and continues this process until a coherent story is generated. The logic behind this ensures that the stories maintain coherence, as the program does not arbitrarily choose words but follows a sound algorithmic approach. A notable feature of my program is its ability to process large texts, such as the entire Bible, and generate a story from it relatively quickly. This project not only enhanced my understanding of Java but also demonstrated the practical applications of Markov chains in text generation.
